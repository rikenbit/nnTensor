Description: Some functions for performing non-negative matrix factorization, non-negative CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition, non-negative Tucker decomposition, and generating toy model data. See Andrzej Cichock et al (2009) and the reference section of GitHub README.md <https://github.com/rikenbit/nnTensor>, for details of the methods.
